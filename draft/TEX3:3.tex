\begin{alertblock}{Remark:}
if we have an estimator for $\mu$ and $\alpha$ noted $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\alpha}$, then $\hat{\mu_i}$ is an estimator with : $$\hat{\mu_i}=  \hat{\mu} +  \hat{\alpha_i}  $$
and $$ (\hat{\mu_1},....,\hat{\mu_I}) \in \argmin\limits_{(\mu_1,....,\mu_I)\in \mathbb{R}^I} \frac{1}{2} \sum\limits_{i=1}^I \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\mu_i)^2$$

so here we have : $$ \hat{\mu_I}=\frac{1}{n_i} \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n_i}y_{ij} = \bar{y_i}$$
